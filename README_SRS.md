## 1. Statement of Purpose

This document defines the software requirements for RevivoLife, a body & wellness platform that connects businesses to customers and consumers. It outlines the systemâ€™s intended functionality, constraints, external dependencies, and goals. It serves as a baseline for design, development, and testing.

---

## 2. Intended Audience

- **Developers**: To implement features and plan architecture  
- **Stakeholders**: To track progress and feature coverage  
- **Testers**: To validate functional and non-functional behavior  
- **Project Managers**: To oversee Agile sprints and milestones  

---

## 3. Scope

RevivoLife aims to connect wellness businesses with users through a digital platform. This version focuses on building a secure onboarding system for business owners.

### Goals and Objectives:
- Implement Sign Up & Sign In functionality
- Integrate Google, Outlook, and Apple authentication
- Use JWT and Bcrypt for secure authentication
- Deliver a modern frontend and scalable backend

### Benefits:
- Streamlined onboarding for businesses
- Secure, extensible backend
- Foundation for full marketplace experience

---

## 4. Constraints

- JWT and Bcrypt must be used for authentication and password security
- OAuth 2.0 protocols must be followed for third-party logins
- Web app must be compatible with major browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
- Use only the defined tech stack
- Frontend must be responsive across desktop and mobile

---

## 5. Assumptions & Dependencies

- The app will be accessed via modern web browsers
- MongoDB Atlas will serve as the cloud database
- OAuth integrations depend on third-party availability and API limits
- External auth libraries (e.g., NextAuth.js) may be used
- Development assumes Linux/macOS environments
- Initial deployment on platforms like Vercel or Render

---

## 6. Functional Requirements

### Must-Have
- Email/password signup for business owners
- Email/password signin (JWT + Bcrypt)
- OAuth login with Google, Outlook, and Apple
- Secure backend API for auth (e.g. `/signup`, `/signin`, `/oauth`)
- Form validation and error messages
- Role-based access for business accounts
- JWT session handling with refresh strategy

### Highly Desired
- Logging of auth events (success/failure)
- Rate limiting for auth endpoints
- Frontend error boundary handling
- Token expiration handling with auto-logout

### Nice to Have
- Multi-language onboarding UI
- "Remember Me" feature
- Dark mode toggle

---

## 7. External Requirements

- Integration with OAuth providers (Google, Outlook, Apple)
- MongoDB for persistent data storage
- External email services for notifications (future)
- REST API communication between frontend and backend

---

## 8. System Features

- **Authentication System**: Secure login and signup with token-based auth
- **Business Onboarding UI**: Frontend form for account creation
- **Error Handling**: Frontend and backend validation logic
- **Responsive Design**: Works across mobile, tablet, and desktop

---

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: API responses under 300ms
- **Scalability**: Backend architecture supports multi-tenant expansion
- **Security**: Passwords hashed with Bcrypt, data encrypted
- **Reliability**: 99.9% auth service uptime
- **Maintainability**: Modular, TypeScript-first codebase
- **Responsiveness**: Optimized UI for all screen sizes
- **Usability**: Clean UX for account access
